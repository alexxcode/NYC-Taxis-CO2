## 2. Project Context
New York City, known for its intense activity and population density, presents a unique setting to study the effects of urban transportation on the environment. Cab and ridesharing services, such as Uber, have revolutionized the way people move around the city. These services not only offer convenience and accessibility but also generate valuable real-time data, such as vehicle locations, trip lengths, fares, and driver ratings. This data is crucial for identifying travel patterns, demand for services, and opportunities to improve efficiency and service quality.

In the context of accelerating climate change and the growing need for cleaner energy, this project seeks to analyze how cabs and ridesharing vehicles contribute to environmental issues. Our client, a forward-thinking passenger transportation company, is interested in expanding into the car-based transportation sector, considering the implementation of electric vehicles for a more sustainable operation.

## 3. Recognizing Client Needs
Our client faces unique challenges in terms of environmental impact and economic efficiency. Their primary need is to assess and improve the relationship between transportation services and factors such as air quality and noise pollution. The company also seeks to optimize its operations and evaluate the feasibility of incorporating electric vehicles into its fleet, aligning its operations with sustainability objectives.

## 4. Project Requirements
To achieve the stated objectives, we need:
- A thorough understanding of the industry and the client's specific challenges.
- Comprehensive access to and analysis of relevant data.
- Alignment of expectations, key objectives and success indicators with the client's needs.
- Adaptation to the conditions and constraints of the client's operating environment.
- Clear and effective communication with the client throughout the project.

- **Available Data**: Obtain a clear view of available data sets, including NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission information, climate data, CO2 emissions and other data relevant to the analysis.
- Expectations and Objectives

## 5. Main objective
Our primary objective is to assess the movement of cabs and ridesharing services in New York City to provide the ride-hailing company with key information on the relationship between these modes of transportation and air quality, noise pollution, and other relevant factors, including more cost-effective alternatives in the long term. This will enable the company to make decisions more in line with its objectives.

## 6. Scope

### 6.1.  Data Scope
- **Focus on Yellow Taxis and FHVs:** Our main area of interest lies in yellow cabs and FHVs. These two types of transportation services account for a significant portion of the traffic in the city and have an abundance of data available. This choice is based on their ability to provide detailed information on trips and their environmental impact.

- **Exclusion of Green Taxis and Other Services:** We have decided to exclude green cabs and other transport services from our main analysis. This decision is justified for several important reasons:

- a. Geographic Limitation:** Green cabs are only authorized to operate in specific geographic areas of New York, primarily Manhattan and some parts of other boroughs. This limits their scope and does not adequately reflect mobility throughout the city.

- b. Lack of Meaningful Historical Data: The data available for green cabs is limited compared to yellow cabs, which have data available since 2009. The availability of historical data is essential for a comprehensive and long-term analysis of urban mobility.

- c. Restricted Areas of Operation: Although green cabs were introduced to improve the availability of cabs in underserved areas, their ability to operate outside of these areas is restricted. This means that they cannot provide a complete representation of mobility throughout the city.

- d. Lack of Detailed Ridesharing Information: Our study focuses on analyzing mobility in detail, including environmental impact assessment. Green cab data may lack important details on ridesharing dynamics and CO2 emissions, making it difficult to accurately assess environmental impact.

In summary, we have made these data delimitation decisions in order to ensure the representativeness and quality of our study. While we recognize the importance of green cabs in New York's transportation system, geographic limitations, lack of historical data, and the absence of detailed ridesharing information make yellow cab and FHV data the most robust and appropriate choice for conducting our analysis of mobility and its environmental impact on the city.

### 6.2. Spatial scope.
- **Focus on New York City:** The analysis is limited to New York City, primarily due to the client's needs, but also due to its traffic density and availability of detailed data. This delimitation allows the study to focus on an urban area with a complex and varied transportation infrastructure, providing a representative case study for cities with similar characteristics.
- **Exclusion of Areas Outside NYC:** No data or analysis from other cities or regions are included. This decision is based on the need to maintain consistency and relevance of the data within the specific context of New York.

### 6.3. Temporal Scope
- The report will use data available up to the most recent date and since 2009 to ensure that the analysis reflects the most recent conditions and trends. This delineation ensures that the report is as current and relevant as possible.** Data will be restricted to the period since 2009 which is the year that cab trip data becomes available. 

- No Projection of Future Trends:** No projections will be made about future trends in transportation or electric vehicle technology, as this would require assumptions and modeling that could lead to speculative conclusions.


#### 6.4. Scope around Technological and Operational assumptions.
- **Basis on Current Electric Vehicle Technology:** The report will be based on the current specifications and performance of electric vehicles, providing a realistic analysis of their feasibility at present. This is because the inclusion of assumptions about future developments could introduce uncertainty and speculation into the analysis.
- Current Charging Infrastructure:** Electric vehicle recommendations will consider the existing charging infrastructure, to provide practical and applicable suggestions in the current context.


## What Are We Seeking To Solve With This Project (objectives)?
1. **Environmental Impact of Passenger Transportation:** Our first objective is to analyze the movement of cabs and ridesharing services in New York City to assess their environmental impact, focusing on the relationship to air quality, noise pollution, and CO2 emissions.

2. **Transit Company Economic Efficiency:** The second objective is to evaluate the economic performance of the ride-sharing company. We will use metrics such as trip length, fare percentage, and operating costs to identify opportunities for efficiency optimization and cost reduction.

3. **Feasibility of Electric Vehicles in the Fleet:** Our third objective is to determine the feasibility of incorporating electric vehicles into the carrier's fleet. This will be based on the results of the environmental and economic analysis. We will provide data-backed recommendations to support informed decision making in this regard.

4. **Identification of Areas for Improvement:** Finally, our fourth objective is to identify specific areas where the company can improve its operational efficiency, reduce its environmental footprint and increase its profitability. These areas of improvement will be derived from a detailed analysis of the data and will be critical to the success and sustainability of the company.
